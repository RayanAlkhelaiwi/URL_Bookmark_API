A RESTful API that provides Bookmarked URLs to visit later.

The backend code follows [PEP-8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

### Getting Started
- Base URL: https://url-bookmark.herokuapp.com/

- Authentication: https://bit.ly/2Ipsvrl

It's recommended to run the project inside a virtual environment. To do this, run the following:

```
virtualenv venv (For first time only)
source venv/bin/activate
```

From the `/backend` folder run `pip3 install requirements.txt`. All required packages are included in the requirements file.

To run the application, run the following commands inside the `/backend` folder:

```
export FLASK_APP=api.py
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run
```
For `Windows` system, replace `export` command with `set` (i.e. `set FLASK_APP=api.py`)

**Frontend** (Not Applicable)

If applicable; inside the `/frontend` folder, run the following commands to start the client:

```
npm install (Only once to install dependencies)
npm start
```

By default, the frontend will run on `localhost:3000`.

**Tests**

To run tests, go back to the `project` folder and run the following commands:

```
dropdb bookmark_test
createdb bookmark_test
python unit_tests.py
```

Omit the `dropdb` command for the first time running the tests.
